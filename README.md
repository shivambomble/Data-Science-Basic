# Data-Science-Basic
In this repository are the models and projects I have created based on data science domain.
Data used in projects are directly available in the repository.

# Instructions for Running Python Notebooks locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

1. India Covid Vaccinations Classification: A model to classify the vaccination categories using various types of classifiers such as Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost. There are three phases for this classification such as data preprocessing, data visualization, data modelling.
2. Electric Vehicle Population Classification: A model to classify two features such as the Electric Vehicle Types categories and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility using various types of classifiers such as Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost. There are three phases for this classification such as data preprocessing, data visualization, data modelling.
